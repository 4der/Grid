# Sprint 3 – Build with CSS grids :radio:

Today's assignment is to implement a pretty advanced grid layout using the new cool [CSS grids.](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) CSS grids will solve many of the layouting problems that we as developers have had to work around in the past – Finally it's here! 

Below is the grid that we will implement, first on desktop and then as a stretch goal for mobile and tablet. In the `assets` folder there's image assets but also a pdf with some supporting lines – also you can copy paste the copy from there. AND learn some more about Helvetica. 



## How to complete this assignment

You can actually choose which technology you will use to implement this, either you go the React way or you do it in vanilla CSS and HTML. The main focus is that you should be using CSS grids to solve the problem. Have a look in the reading material on how to start using CSS grids. 

To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, add your code in the "code" folder, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into the Technigo one) for review. [Read the guide on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more info on how to do this.
